📁 Python File Management System (CLI)

A powerful command-line based File Management System built with Python that allows users to manage files and folders efficiently.
This tool supports listing, renaming, moving, copying, deleting, creating, reading, analyzing, and converting files — all from a single interactive interface.

🚀 Project Overview

Managing files manually can be time-consuming and error-prone.
This project provides a menu-driven CLI application that automates common file operations using Python’s standard libraries:

os

shutil

It is ideal for:

Beginners learning Python file handling

Automating repetitive file tasks

Practicing real-world CLI development

🧠 Key Features

✔ Interactive command-line interface
✔ Works on any operating system
✔ Uses only built-in Python libraries
✔ Handles files and folders
✔ Error handling for safer operations

✨ Functionalities (Step by Step)
1️⃣ List Files & Folders

Show all files and folders

Show specific files by extension

Search for a file or folder

2️⃣ Rename Files

Rename a single file

Rename multiple files automatically with numbering

3️⃣ Move Files

Move a single file

Move multiple files by extension

Automatically creates destination folders if missing

4️⃣ Copy Files & Folders

Copy single or multiple files

Copy single or multiple folders

Supports extension-based copying

5️⃣ Delete Files & Folders

Delete single or multiple files

Delete empty or non-empty folders

Supports bulk deletion by extension

⚠️ Use carefully — deleted data cannot be recovered.

6️⃣ Create Files & Folders

Create single or multiple files

Create single or multiple folders

Automatic numbering for bulk creation

7️⃣ Read Files

Read and display file content directly in the terminal

8️⃣ File Details (Analytics)

Displays:

Total characters

Total words

Total lines

Useful for quick file analysis 📊

9️⃣ Convert Files

Convert a single file extension

Convert multiple files with renaming

Uses safe renaming logic

⚠️ Existing data may be overwritten.

🖥️ How the Program Works

User enters the main folder name

Program runs in a continuous loop

User selects an operation:

list / rename / move / copy / delete / create / read / detail / convert


Program executes the selected task

User can exit anytime using:

exit

🧰 Technologies Used
