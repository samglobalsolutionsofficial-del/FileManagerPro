To count the *total number of characters* in a file using Python, you can follow this simple approach:

✅ *Step-by-Step Code:*

```python
def count_characters(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()
        total_chars = len(content)
        print(f"Total Characters: {total_chars}")
```

🧠 *Explanation:*
- `open(file_path, 'r')`: Opens the file in read mode.
- `file.read()`: Reads the entire content of the file as a string.
- `len(content)`: Returns the number of characters in the string (includes spaces, newline characters, punctuation, etc.).

📌 Example:
If your file `data.txt` contains:
```
Hello World
Python is awesome!
```

Calling `count_characters('data.txt')` will print:
```
Total Characters: 30
```

Let me know if you want to include this in a CLI tool using `sys.argv`.

🔧 *Project Idea: File Analyzer CLI Tool*

📌 *Objective:*
Create a command-line tool that analyzes a given text file and provides useful statistics.

---

📥 *Input (From User via CLI):*
The user will pass:
1. *Script name* (automatically from Python)
2. *Operation* (what they want to do: `lines`, `words`, or `chars`)
3. *File path* (the name/path of the text file to analyze)

Example CLI Command:
```bash
python file_analyzer.py words myfile.txt
```

---

📤 *Expected Output:*
Based on the operation:
- If `lines` → Total number of lines in the file.
- If `words` → Total number of words.
- If `chars` → Total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation).

---

💡 *Why It's Useful:*
- Helps quickly analyze files via terminal without opening them.
- Good practice for working with `sys.argv`, file I/O, and conditionals.

Example CLI Command:
```bash
python file_analyzer.py words myfile.txt
```

---

📤 *Expected Output:*
Based on the operation:
- If `lines` → Total number of lines in the file.
- If `words` → Total number of words.
- If `chars` → Total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation).

---

💡 *Why It's Useful:*
- Helps quickly analyze files via terminal without opening them.
- Good practice for working with `sys.argv`, file I/O, and conditionals.
